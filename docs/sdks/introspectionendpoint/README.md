This API gathers information about an access token.

<br>
<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

This API is supposed to be called from within the implementations of protected resource endpoints
of the authorization server implementation in order to get information about the access token which
was presented by the client application.

In general, a client application accesses a protected resource endpoint of a service with an access
token, and the implementation of the endpoint checks whether the presented access token has enough
privileges (= scopes) to access the protected resource before returning the protected resource to
the client application. To achieve this flow, the endpoint implementation has to know detailed
information about the access token. Authlete `/auth/introspection` API can be used to get such information.

The response from `/auth/introspection` API has some parameters. Among them, it is `action` parameter
that the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes the next action
that the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value of `action`, the
authorization server implementation must take the steps described below.

**INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**

When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization
server implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.
In either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side.
Therefore, the service implementation should generate a response to the client application with
HTTP status of "500 Internal Server Error". Authlete recommends `application/json` as the content
type although OAuth 2.0 specification does not mention the format of the error response when the
redirect URI is not usable.

The value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of
[RFC 6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage), so if
the protected resource of the service implementation wants to return an error response to the client
application in the way that complies with RFC 6750 (in other words, if `accessTokenType` configuration
parameter of the service is Bearer), the value of `responseContent` can be used as the value of
`WWW-Authenticate` header.

The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.

```
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{responseContent}
```

**BAD_REQUEST**

When the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client application
does not contain an access token (= the request from the authorization server implementation to
Authlete does not contain `token` request parameter).

A response with HTTP status of "400 Bad Request" must be returned to the client application and
the content type must be `application/json`.


The value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC
6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage), so if the
protected resource of the service implementation wants to return an error response to the client
application in the way that complies with RFC 6750 (in other words, if `accessTokenType` configuration
parameter of the service is `Bearer`), the value of `responseContent` can be used as the value of
`WWW-Authenticate` header.

The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache
```

**UNAUTHORIZED**

When the value of `action` is `UNAUTHORIZED`, it means that the access token does not exist or has
expired.

The value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of RFC
6750 (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage), so if the protected resource of the service implementation
wants to return an error response to the client application in the way that complies with [RFC
6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (in other words, if `accessTokenType` configuration
parameter of the service is `Bearer`), the value of `responseContent` can be used as the value of
`WWW-Authenticate` header.

The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.

```
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache
```

**FORBIDDEN**

When the value of `action` is `FORBIDDEN`, it means that the access token does not cover the required
scopes or that the subject associated with the access token is different from the subject contained
in the request.

A response with HTTP status of "400 Bad Request" must be returned to the client application and
the content type must be `application/json`.

The value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC
6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage), so if the
protected resource of the service implementation wants to return an error response to the client
application in the way that complies with RFC 6750 (in other words, if `accessTokenType` configuration
parameter of the service is Bearer), the value of `responseContent` can be used as the value of
`WWW-Authenticate` header.

The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.

```
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache
```

**OK**

When the value of `action` is `OK`, it means that the access token which the client application
presented is valid (= exists and has not expired).

The implementation of the protected resource endpoint is supposed to return the protected resource
to the client application.

When action is `OK`, the value of `responseContent` is `"Bearer error=\"invalid_request\""`. This
is the simplest string which can be used as the value of `WWW-Authenticate` header to indicate
"400 Bad Request". The implementation of the protected resource endpoint may use this string to
tell the client application that the request was bad (e.g. in case necessary request parameters
for the protected resource endpoint are missing). However, in such a case, the implementation
should generate a more informative error message to help developers of client applications.

The following is an example error response which complies with RFC 6750.

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache
```

Basically, The value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of
[RFC 6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage). So, if
the service has selected `Bearer` as the value of `accessTokenType` configuration parameter, the
value of `responseContent` can be used directly as the value of `WWW-Authenticate` header. However,
if the service has selected another different token type, the service has to generate error messages
for itself.

_**JWT-based access token**_

Since version 2.1, Authlete provides a feature to issue access tokens in JWT format. This feature
can be enabled by setting a non-null value to the `accessTokenSignAlg` property of the service
(see the description of the Service class for details). `/api/auth/introspection` API can accept
access tokens in JWT format. However, note that the API does not return information contained in
a given JWT-based access token but returns information stored in the database record which corresponds
to the given JWT-based access token. Because attributes of the database record can be modified
after the access token is issued (for example, by using `/api/auth/token/update` API), information
returned by `/api/auth/introspection` API and information the given JWT-based access token holds
may be different.

## processForm

This API gathers information about an access token.

<br>
<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

This API is supposed to be called from within the implementations of protected resource endpoints
of the authorization server implementation in order to get information about the access token which
was presented by the client application.

In general, a client application accesses a protected resource endpoint of a service with an access
token, and the implementation of the endpoint checks whether the presented access token has enough
privileges (= scopes) to access the protected resource before returning the protected resource to
the client application. To achieve this flow, the endpoint implementation has to know detailed
information about the access token. Authlete `/auth/introspection` API can be used to get such information.

The response from `/auth/introspection` API has some parameters. Among them, it is `action` parameter
that the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes the next action
that the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value of `action`, the
authorization server implementation must take the steps described below.

**INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**

When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization
server implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.
In either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side.
Therefore, the service implementation should generate a response to the client application with
HTTP status of "500 Internal Server Error". Authlete recommends `application/json` as the content
type although OAuth 2.0 specification does not mention the format of the error response when the
redirect URI is not usable.

The value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of
[RFC 6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage), so if
the protected resource of the service implementation wants to return an error response to the client
application in the way that complies with RFC 6750 (in other words, if `accessTokenType` configuration
parameter of the service is Bearer), the value of `responseContent` can be used as the value of
`WWW-Authenticate` header.

The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.

```
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache

{responseContent}
```

**BAD_REQUEST**

When the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client application
does not contain an access token (= the request from the authorization server implementation to
Authlete does not contain `token` request parameter).

A response with HTTP status of "400 Bad Request" must be returned to the client application and
the content type must be `application/json`.


The value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC
6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage), so if the
protected resource of the service implementation wants to return an error response to the client
application in the way that complies with RFC 6750 (in other words, if `accessTokenType` configuration
parameter of the service is `Bearer`), the value of `responseContent` can be used as the value of
`WWW-Authenticate` header.

The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache
```

**UNAUTHORIZED**

When the value of `action` is `UNAUTHORIZED`, it means that the access token does not exist or has
expired.

The value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of RFC
6750 (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage), so if the protected resource of the service implementation
wants to return an error response to the client application in the way that complies with [RFC
6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (in other words, if `accessTokenType` configuration
parameter of the service is `Bearer`), the value of `responseContent` can be used as the value of
`WWW-Authenticate` header.

The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.

```
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache
```

**FORBIDDEN**

When the value of `action` is `FORBIDDEN`, it means that the access token does not cover the required
scopes or that the subject associated with the access token is different from the subject contained
in the request.

A response with HTTP status of "400 Bad Request" must be returned to the client application and
the content type must be `application/json`.

The value of `responseContent` is a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC
6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage), so if the

application in the way that complies with RFC 6750 (in other words, if `accessTokenType` configuration
parameter of the service is Bearer), the value of `responseContent` can be used as the value of
`WWW-Authenticate` header.

The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750.

```
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache
```

**OK**

When the value of `action` is `OK`, it means that the access token which the client application
presented is valid (= exists and has not expired).

The implementation of the protected resource endpoint is supposed to return the protected resource
to the client application.

When action is `OK`, the value of `responseContent` is `"Bearer error=\"invalid_request\""`. This
is the simplest string which can be used as the value of `WWW-Authenticate` header to indicate
"400 Bad Request". The implementation of the protected resource endpoint may use this string to
tell the client application that the request was bad (e.g. in case necessary request parameters
for the protected resource endpoint are missing). However, in such a case, the implementation
should generate a more informative error message to help developers of client applications.

The following is an example error response which complies with RFC 6750.

```

the service has selected `Bearer` as the value of `accessTokenType` configuration parameter, the
value of `responseContent` can be used directly as the value of `WWW-Authenticate` header. However,
if the service has selected another different token type, the service has to generate error messages
for itself.

_**JWT-based access token**_

Since version 2.1, Authlete provides a feature to issue access tokens in JWT format. This feature
can be enabled by setting a non-null value to the `accessTokenSignAlg` property of the service
(see the description of the Service class for details). `/api/auth/introspection` API can accept
